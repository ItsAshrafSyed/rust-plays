    //// ownership:
    // 1.each value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its owner.
    // 2.there can only be one owner at a time.
    // 3.when the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
    //// borrowing & references:
    // 1.references allow you to refer to some value without taking ownership of it.
    // 2.you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references to a value.
